Call Center Analytics Research Prompts
Single comprehensive prompt for themes/tags-based analytics
"""

# Main call center campaign prompt with themes and tags
CALL_CENTER_CAMPAIGN_PROMPT = """**PROMPT:**

Research the company **{company_name}** for call center analytics and cost/value optimization opportunities.

Call center analytics will be delivered by transcribing customer calls into timestamped transcripts, followed by LLM-powered topic and sentiment classification via **AI_CLASSIFY**, **AI_COMPLETE (Structured Outputs)**, and (as needed) **AI_AGG** in Snowflake Cortex.

---

**Your Tasks:**

1. **Surface Real-World Customer and Business Pain:**
   - Crawl and summarize complaint patterns, recurring pain points, and "reason for call" topics about **{company_name}** from:
     - BBB.org (resolution times, specific product/service friction, escalation and lost revenue risk)
     - PissedConsumer (root causes, escalation, re-contact triggers)
     - Reddit and relevant forums (live debate, technical issues, process themes, switching/competitive complaints)
     - Consumer review sites (Trustpilot, Sitejabber, Google Reviews, etc. if available) â€” extract main complaint/feedback themes
     - Macro news (lawsuits, regulatory events, product launches, support outages, public CX crises)
   - **Extract and list the top complaint/feedback themes** that repeat across these sources; make them product, service, or policy specific (not generic "support unhelpful").

2. **Verify and Output Core Company Contact Info:**
   - Find and validate the **official website URL**.
   - Find and validate the **call center or customer support phone number**.

3. **Document Data Enrichment Potential:**
   - At the top of the JSON output, list likely data sets the customer has for possible enrichment and integration with call analytics.

4. **Derive Deep, Creative Use Cases That Map Directly to Value for {company_name}:**
   - **Be Creative and Deep**: Go beyond basic complaint resolution. Consider advanced analytics like:
     - Cross-process agent performance analytics with 360-degree KPI views
     - Real-time sentiment prediction and dynamic call routing
     - Predictive churn modeling based on conversation patterns
     - Agent coaching automation using AI-powered quality assurance
     - Revenue optimization through upsell/cross-sell moment detection
     - Competitive intelligence from conversation mining
     - Regulatory compliance monitoring and risk flagging
     - Customer journey optimization across multiple touchpoints
     - Proactive issue prevention using predictive analytics
   - Each use case must stem from high-frequency or high-impact call types and demonstrated themes
   - Make every use case value-driven with specific business impact quantification
   - **Include at least one use case for competitive intelligence and one for predictive analytics**
   - Ensure there are **at least 20 business questions total across all use cases**
   - Each business question must include a `required_data_sets` field

5. **Create Consumable Themes and Tags Structure:**
   - **Themes**: High-level conceptual categories (e.g., "escalation language patterns", "competitor switching signals")
   - **Tags**: Specific, detectable keywords, phrases, or patterns that can be aggregated, windowed, and ratio'd to tell stories about themes (e.g., "WastingMyTime_GetManager", "CompetitorX_BetterPrice", "RefundDelay_BankDispute")
   - Tags should be specific enough that when aggregated over time windows and compared as ratios, they provide actionable insights about the theme

6. **Output the following JSON structure:**

**Instructions:**
- **Create consumable tags**: Make tags specific keywords/phrases that can be detected, counted, and analyzed over time windows (e.g., daily, weekly ratios)
- **Ensure tag aggregation value**: Tags should be designed so that when aggregated, windowed, and ratio'd, they tell clear stories about business themes and enable actionable decisions
- **Link themes to tags**: Each theme should have 3-8 corresponding specific tags that, when analyzed together, provide insights about that theme
- **Make tags business-relevant**: Focus on tags that directly connect to revenue, cost, or risk outcomes for the specific company
- **Be deeply creative**: Apply sophisticated analytical approaches using tag combinations, ratios, and temporal patterns
- **Base on real research**: Ground all themes and tags in actual complaint patterns and business realities discovered from research sources
- Include at least 20 total business questions across all use cases with required data sets specified
- Output only the JSONâ€”fully populated, valid, ready-to-use"""
