Then I'll research this company comprehensively to create a detailed call center analytics use case.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see:\n\n1. Major pain points:\n- VIP membership billing issues: Customers being charged monthly for VIP memberships they didn't want or forgot about\n- Credit expiration: Company changed terms to make credits expire after 12 months, customers lost hundreds of dollars\n- Difficulty canceling subscriptions: Multiple customers report inability to cancel recurring charges\n- Unauthorized charges: Customers report being charged without authorization\n- Customer service issues: Long resolution times, unhelpful responses\n\n2. Specific patterns from BBB complaints:\n- One customer mentions being charged from $39 to $45/month since 2019 for a single $30 purchase\n- Customers report being charged VIP credits they didn't agree to\n- Credit expiration policy changed without proper consent (October 2023)\n- Company responds that \"reinstatement of expired credits is no longer possible\"\n\n3. From PissedConsumer:\n- Monthly fees charged without purchases\n- Â£44.95 and $49.95 unauthorized charges\n- Damaged/incomplete orders\n- Automatic deductions from debit cards\n\n4.

Comprehensive Primary Research & Pain Point Analysis\nCrawl and systematically analyze complaint patterns, recurring pain points, and \"reason for call\" topics about **JustFab** from:\n- **BBB.org**: Resolution times, specific product/service friction, escalation and lost revenue risk\n- **PissedConsumer**: Root causes, escalation, re-contact triggers  \n- **Reddit and relevant forums**: Live debate, technical issues, process themes, switching/competitive complaints\n- **Consumer review sites**: Trustpilot, Sitejabber, Google Reviews - extract main complaint/feedback themes\n- **Macro news**: Lawsuits, regulatory events, product launches, support outages, public CX crises\n\n**Output Requirements:**\n- **Document specific, quantified pain points** with frequency/severity indicators\n- **Extract competitor-specific mentions** and switching triggers\n- **Identify process friction points** that appear across multiple channels\n- **List regulatory/compliance concerns** if any appear in research\n- **Summarize seasonal or temporal patterns** in complaints\n\n### 2. Verify Core Company Contact Info\n- Find and validate the **official website URL**\n- Find and validate the **call center or customer support phone number**\n\n### 3. Document Data Enrichment Potential\nList likely data sets the customer has for possible enrichment and integration with call analytics.\n\n### 4. Research-to-Use-Case Mapping (MANDATORY)\n**Every use case MUST directly reference and tie back to specific findings from your primary research.**\n\nFor each use case:\n- **Quote specific complaint patterns** or pain points discovered in research\n- **Reference competitor mentions** or switching patterns found\n- **Tie themes and tags** directly to actual customer language/issues discovered\n- **Show clear connection** between research findings and business value proposition\n\n### 5. Advanced Use Case Development with SQL Implementation\n**Requirements:**\n- Include at least one **competitive intelligence** use case\n- Include at least one **predictive analytics** use case  \n- Include at least one **real-time intervention** use case\n- Each use case must have **at least 5-7 business questions**\n- **Each business question must have its own dedicated SQL view DDL**\n- **Each business question must include a SQL query** against its view that delivers the insight\n- **Each SQL query must include reasoning and chain of thought**\n\n### 6. SQL Query Reasoning Requirements\nFor every SQL query, you must provide:\n- **Business Logic**: What business problem this query solves\n- **Data Relationships**: How the tables/views connect to answer the question  \n- **Aggregation Strategy**: Why these specific aggregations/windows were chosen\n- **Expected Output**: What the query results will look like and how they drive action\n- **Performance Considerations**: How the query would scale and perform\n\n---\n\n## Output JSON Structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"primary_research_summary\": {\n    \"top_pain_points\": [\n      {\n        \"pain_point\": \"Specific complaint pattern found\",\n        \"frequency_indicator\": \"High/Medium/Low based on mentions across sources\",\n        \"sources\": [\"BBB\", \"Reddit\", \"PissedConsumer\"],\n        \"sample_customer_quotes\": [\"Actual quote 1\", \"Actual quote 2\"],\n        \"business_impact_potential\": \"Revenue/Cost/Risk impact description\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"competitor_intelligence\": [\n      {\n        \"competitor_name\": \"CompetitorX\",\n        \"switching_triggers\": [\"Specific reason 1\", \"Specific reason 2\"],\n        \"frequency_of_mentions\": \"Quantified mentions across sources\",\n        \"customer_comparison_points\": [\"Feature gap\", \"Pricing issue\", \"Service quality\"]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"regulatory_compliance_findings\": [\n      \"Any compliance or legal issues found in research\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"data_customer_likely_has\": [\n    \"CRM (customer profiles, purchase history, lifecycle stage)\",\n    \"ERP (orders, fulfillment, inventory, refunds)\",\n    \"Product registration/warranty database\",\n    \"E-commerce transaction logs\",\n    \"Customer feedback surveys/NPS scores\",\n    \"IVR/call disposition and routing logs\",\n    \"Marketing campaign data and attribution\",\n    \"Agent performance metrics and scorecards\",\n    \"Knowledge base and FAQ interaction logs\",\n    \"Social media monitoring data\",\n    \"Competitive pricing and feature data\",\n    \"Financial/billing system data\"\n  ],\n  \"company_website\": \"company_website_url\",\n  \"call_center_number\": \"company_phone_number\",\n  \"call_center_usecases\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Use Case Name\",\n      \"research_foundation\": {\n        \"primary_research_citations\": [\n          \"Specific pain point from research that drives this use case\",\n          \"Competitor mention or switching pattern that informs this use case\",\n          \"Customer language/complaint that shaped these themes and tags\"\n        ],\n        \"quantified_business_problem\": \"X% of customers mention Y problem leading to $Z business impact\"\n      },\n      \"themes_to_track\": [\n        \"theme_based_on_actual_research_findings\",\n        \"theme_tied_to_competitor_mentions\", \n        \"theme_from_complaint_patterns\"\n      ],\n      \"tags_to_track\": [\n        \"ActualCustomerLanguage_ActionPattern\",\n        \"ResearchBased_OutcomeIndicator\",\n        \"CompetitorSpecific_SwitchingSignal\"\n      ],\n      \"Value_Drivers\": [\"Increase Revenue\", \"Decrease Cost\", \"Decrease Brand Risk\"],\n      \"Reasoning_for_Value_Prop\": \"Clear explanation tying research findings to business value through tag-based analytics.\",\n      \"TopicsToInsight\": \"How tag analysis, ratios, and patterns reveal actionable insights based on research.\",\n      \"Insights_Unlocked\": [\n        {\n          \"business_question\": \"Specific question that can be answered with SQL analysis?\",\n          \"required_data_sets\": [\"call_tags\", \"customer_data\", \"outcome_metrics\"],\n          \"view_ddl\": \"CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW business_question_1_analytics AS\\n-- Complete SQL DDL for this specific business question\\nSELECT \\n  call_id,\\n  customer_id,\\n  tag_name,\\n  tag_timestamp,\\n  -- Specific columns needed for this question\\n  COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY tag_timestamp \\n                 RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '7 days' PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as rolling_7day_count,\\n  RATIO_TO_REPORT(tag_count) OVER (PARTITION BY call_id) as tag_ratio_in_call\\nFROM call_transcripts ct\\nJOIN call_tags ctags ON ct.call_id = ctags.call_id\\nJOIN customer_data cd ON ct.customer_id = cd.customer_id\\nWHERE tag_name IN ('ResearchBased_Tag1', 'ResearchBased_Tag2')\\n  AND timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE -
