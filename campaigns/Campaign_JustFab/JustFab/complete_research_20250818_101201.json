    "prompt_used": "\nThe user is pointing out that the topics we're generating are too high-level/abstract and not consumable for actual implementation. They want to distinguish between:\n\n1. **Themes** - Higher level conceptual categories (like \"escalation language patterns\")\n2. **Tags** - Specific, actionable, measurable items that can be detected and tracked (like \"WastingMyTime_GetManager\")\n\nThe key insight is that tags should be specific enough that when you aggregate them, window them (time-based analysis), and create ratios, they tell a story about the theme or use case.\n\nLooking at the search results, I can see examples of this approach:\n- From [1]: \"thematic taxonomy design\" involves identifying core themes and organizing them in a structured hierarchy\n- From [2]: \"text analytics tool uses machine learning NLP to auto-analyse and tag customer conversations based on sentiment, reasons for contact, and more\" and mentions \"precise tags\"\n- From [4]: \"Tag calls using specific keywords and phrases that apply to your business\"\n- From [5]: Shows examples of specific questions that can be asked when combining data sources\n\nSo the user wants me to modify the prompt to:\n1. Have both \"themes\" and \"tags\" in the structure\n2. Make tags specific/consumable (like keywords/phrases that can be detected)\n3. Ensure tags can be aggregated, windowed, and ratio'd to tell stories about themes\n4. Return the prompt in copy-paste friendly format\n\nLet me revise the JSON structure and prompt accordingly.\n\n\n**PROMPT:**\n\nResearch the company **JustFab** for call center analytics and cost/value optimization opportunities.\n\nCall center analytics will be delivered by transcribing customer calls into timestamped transcripts, followed by LLM-powered topic and sentiment classification via **AI_CLASSIFY**, **AI_COMPLETE (Structured Outputs)**, and (as needed) **AI_AGG** in Snowflake Cortex.\n\n---\n\n**Your Tasks:**\n\n1. **Surface Real-World Customer and Business Pain:**\n   - Crawl and summarize complaint patterns, recurring pain points, and \"reason for call\" topics about **JustFab** from:\n     - BBB.org (resolution times, specific product/service friction, escalation and lost revenue risk)\n     - PissedConsumer (root causes, escalation, re-contact triggers)\n     - Reddit and relevant forums (live debate, technical issues, process themes, switching/competitive complaints)\n     - Consumer review sites (Trustpilot, Sitejabber, Google Reviews, etc. if available) — extract main complaint/feedback themes\n     - Macro news (lawsuits, regulatory events, product launches, support outages, public CX crises)\n   - **Extract and list the top complaint/feedback themes** that repeat across these sources; make them product, service, or policy specific (not generic \"support unhelpful\").\n\n2. **Verify and Output Core Company Contact Info:**\n   - Find and validate the **official website URL**.\n   - Find and validate the **call center or customer support phone number**.\n\n3. **Document Data Enrichment Potential:**\n   - At the top of the JSON output, list likely data sets the customer has for possible enrichment and integration with call analytics.\n\n4. **Derive Deep, Creative Use Cases That Map Directly to Value for JustFab:**\n   - **Be Creative and Deep**: Go beyond basic complaint resolution. Consider advanced analytics like:\n     - Cross-process agent performance analytics with 360-degree KPI views\n     - Real-time sentiment prediction and dynamic call routing\n     - Predictive churn modeling based on conversation patterns\n     - Agent coaching automation using AI-powered quality assurance\n     - Revenue optimization through upsell/cross-sell moment detection\n     - Competitive intelligence from conversation mining\n     - Regulatory compliance monitoring and risk flagging\n     - Customer journey optimization across multiple touchpoints\n     - Proactive issue prevention using predictive analytics\n   - Each use case must stem from high-frequency or high-impact call types and demonstrated themes\n   - Make every use case value-driven with specific business impact quantification\n   - **Include at least one use case for competitive intelligence and one for predictive analytics**\n   - Ensure there are **at least 20 business questions total across all use cases**\n   - Each business question must include a `required_data_sets` field\n\n5. **Create Consumable Themes and Tags Structure:**\n   - **Themes**: High-level conceptual categories (e.g., \"escalation language patterns\", \"competitor switching signals\")\n   - **Tags**: Specific, detectable keywords, phrases, or patterns that can be aggregated, windowed, and ratio'd to tell stories about themes (e.g., \"WastingMyTime_GetManager\", \"CompetitorX_BetterPrice\", \"RefundDelay_BankDispute\")\n   - Tags should be specific enough that when aggregated over time windows and compared as ratios, they provide actionable insights about the theme\n\n6. **Output the following JSON structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data_customer_likely_has\": [\n    \"CRM (customer profiles, purchase history, lifecycle stage)\",\n    \"ERP (orders, fulfillment, inventory, refunds)\",\n    \"Product registration/warranty database\",\n    \"E-commerce transaction logs\",\n    \"Customer feedback surveys/NPS scores\",\n    \"IVR/call disposition and routing logs\",\n    \"Marketing campaign data and attribution\",\n    \"Agent performance metrics and scorecards\",\n    \"Knowledge base and FAQ interaction logs\",\n    \"Social media monitoring data\",\n    \"Competitive pricing and feature data\",\n    \"Financial/billing system data\"\n  ],\n  \"company_website\": \"{company_website_url}\",\n  \"call_center_number\": \"{company_phone_number}\",\n  \"call_center_usecases\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Predictive Churn Detection with Real-Time Intervention Triggers\",\n      \"themes_to_track\": [\n        \"escalation_language_patterns\",\n        \"competitor_switching_signals\", \n        \"value_proposition_questioning\",\n        \"cancellation_exploration_behavior\"\n      ],\n      \"tags_to_track\": [\n        \"WastingMyTime_GetManager\",\n        \"CompetitorX_BetterPrice\",\n        \"CancelSubscription_HowTo\",\n        \"NotWorthTheMoney_Overpriced\",\n        \"SwitchingTo_CompetitorY\",\n        \"RefundRequest_Immediate\",\n        \"UnresolvedIssue_MultipleContacts\",\n        \"FrustrationLevel_High\"\n      ],\n      \"Value_Drivers\": [\"Increase Revenue\", \"Decrease Brand Risk\"],\n      \"Reasoning_for_Value_Prop\": \"Advanced sentiment analysis combined with conversation pattern recognition can predict churn probability in real-time, triggering immediate retention actions during the call itself rather than post-call surveys.
