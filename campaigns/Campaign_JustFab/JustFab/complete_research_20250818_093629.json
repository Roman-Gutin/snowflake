This version requires extraction of complaint themes from real consumer sources (BBB, PissedConsumer, Reddit, etc.), ensures those are mapped into analytics use cases, and mandates a competitive intelligence component. The output is actionable, business-outcome-focused, and includes quantitative value.\n\n---\n\n**PROMPT:**  \n\nResearch the company **JustFab** for call center analytics and cost/value optimization opportunities.\n\nCall center analytics will be delivered by transcribing customer calls into timestamped transcripts, followed by LLM-powered topic and sentiment classification via **AI_CLASSIFY**, **AI_COMPLETE (Structured Outputs)**, and (as needed) **AI_AGG** in Snowflake Cortex.\n\n---\n\n**Your Tasks:**\n\n1. **Surface Real-World Customer and Business Pain:**\n   - Crawl and summarize complaint patterns, recurring pain points, and “reason for call” topics about **JustFab** from:\n     - BBB.org (resolution times, specific product/service friction, escalation and lost revenue risk)\n     - PissedConsumer (root causes, escalation, re-contact triggers)\n     - Reddit and relevant forums (live debate, technical issues, process themes, switching/competitive complaints)\n     - Consumer review sites (Trustpilot, Sitejabber, Google Reviews, etc. if available) — extract main complaint/feedback themes\n     - Macro news (lawsuits, regulatory events, product launches, support outages, public CX crises)\n   - **Extract and list the top complaint/feedback themes** that repeat across these sources; make them product, service, or policy specific (not generic “support unhelpful”).\n\n2. **Verify and Output Core Company Contact Info:**\n   - Find and validate the **official website URL**.\n   - Find and validate the **call center or customer support phone number**.\n\n3. **Derive Use Cases That Map Directly to Value for JustFab:**\n   - Each use case must stem from high-frequency or high-impact call types and demonstrated themes (e.g., order fulfillment, technical setup glitch, account login issue, billing dispute, competitor ad switching).\n   - Make every use case value-driven: show *how and where analytics unlock business impact*, such as by shaving average handle time, reducing volume, improving first contact resolution, automating FAQs, or precisely targeting at-risk revenue streams.\n   - Show how “reason for call” or closely-related complaint topics enable these savings and strategy improvements.\n   - **Include at least one use case focused on competitive intelligence, benchmarking, or churn/switching triggers.** Use knowledge of competitor pain points from the above sources.\n   - For every use case, quantify the value as much as possible (e.g., “Reducing refund confusion calls 8% will save $X million/year in labor, chargeback cost, and retention”).\n\n4. **Output the following JSON structure:**  \n   *(Replace curly braces with real values and tailor topics/insights to the actual result of your analysis for JustFab)*\n```json\n{\n  \"company_website\": \"{company_website_url}\",\n  \"call_center_number\": \"{company_phone_number}\",\n  \"call_center_usecases\": [    {\n      \"name\": \"Reduce Product Setup Calls by Closing Knowledge Gaps\",\n      \"topics_to_track\": [        \"setup confusion for {product_or_service}\",\n        \"missing quick start guide\",\n        \"registration failed\",\n        \"wifi/setup error on new OS\"\n      ],\n      \"Value_Drivers\": [\"Decrease Cost\", \"Increase Revenue\"],\n      \"Reasoning_for_Value_Prop\": \"High-volume setup calls drive up labor expense and frustrate the onboarding experience.
