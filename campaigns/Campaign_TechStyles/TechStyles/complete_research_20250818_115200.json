    "prompt_used": "Here's an improved, copy-paste friendly prompt that includes the semantic SQL DDL requirement for a more prescriptive system:\n\nPROMPT: Call Center Analytics Research & Use Case Development\n\nResearch the company TechStyles for call center analytics and cost/value optimization opportunities.\n\nCall center analytics will be delivered by transcribing customer calls into timestamped transcripts, followed by LLM-powered topic and sentiment classification via AI_CLASSIFY, AI_COMPLETE (Structured Outputs), and AI_AGG in Snowflake Cortex.\n\nYour Tasks:\n1. Surface Real-World Customer and Business Pain\nCrawl and summarize complaint patterns, recurring pain points, and \"reason for call\" topics about TechStyles from:\n\nBBB.org: Resolution times, specific product/service friction, escalation and lost revenue risk\n\nPissedConsumer: Root causes, escalation, re-contact triggers\n\nReddit and relevant forums: Live debate, technical issues, process themes, switching/competitive complaints\n\nConsumer review sites: Trustpilot, Sitejabber, Google Reviews - extract main complaint/feedback themes\n\nMacro news: Lawsuits, regulatory events, product launches, support outages, public CX crises\n\nExtract and list the top complaint/feedback themes that repeat across sources - make them product, service, or policy specific (not generic \"support unhelpful\").\n\n2. Verify Core Company Contact Info\nFind and validate the official website URL\n\nFind and validate the call center or customer support phone number\n\n3. Document Data Enrichment Potential\nList likely data sets the customer has for possible enrichment and integration with call analytics.\n\n4. Derive Deep, Creative Use Cases with Business Impact\nBe Creative and Deep - Go beyond basic complaint resolution. Consider advanced analytics like:\n\nCross-process agent performance analytics with 360-degree KPI views\n\nReal-time sentiment prediction and dynamic call routing\n\nPredictive churn modeling based on conversation patterns\n\nAgent coaching automation using AI-powered quality assurance\n\nRevenue optimization through upsell/cross-sell moment detection\n\nCompetitive intelligence from conversation mining\n\nRegulatory compliance monitoring and risk flagging\n\nCustomer journey optimization across multiple touchpoints\n\nProactive issue prevention using predictive analytics\n\nRequirements:\n\nEach use case must stem from high-frequency or high-impact call types and demonstrated themes\n\nMake every use case value-driven with specific business impact quantification\n\nInclude at least one use case for competitive intelligence and one for predictive analytics\n\nEnsure there are at least 20 business questions total across all use cases\n\nEach business question must include a required_data_sets field\n\nEach use case must include a semantic_sql_ddl field with SQL view definitions\n\n5. Create Consumable Themes and Tags Structure\nThemes: High-level conceptual categories (e.g., \"escalation language patterns\", \"competitor switching signals\")\n\nTags: Specific, detectable keywords, phrases, or patterns that can be aggregated, windowed, and ratio'd (e.g., \"WastingMyTime_GetManager\", \"CompetitorX_BetterPrice\", \"RefundDelay_BankDispute\")\n\nTags should be specific enough that when aggregated over time windows and compared as ratios, they provide actionable insights about the theme\n\nOutput JSON Structure:\njson\n{\n  \"data_customer_likely_has\": [\n    \"CRM (customer profiles, purchase history, lifecycle stage)\",\n    \"ERP (orders, fulfillment, inventory, refunds)\",\n    \"Product registration/warranty database\",\n    \"E-commerce transaction logs\",\n    \"Customer feedback surveys/NPS scores\",\n    \"IVR/call disposition and routing logs\",\n    \"Marketing campaign data and attribution\",\n    \"Agent performance metrics and scorecards\",\n    \"Knowledge base and FAQ interaction logs\",\n    \"Social media monitoring data\",\n    \"Competitive pricing and feature data\",\n    \"Financial/billing system data\"\n  ],\n  \"company_website\": \"company_website_url\",\n  \"call_center_number\": \"company_phone_number\",\n  \"call_center_usecases\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Use Case Name\",\n      \"themes_to_track\": [\n        \"theme_1\",\n        \"theme_2\", \n        \"theme_3\"\n      ],\n      \"tags_to_track\": [\n        \"SpecificTag_Action\",\n        \"MeasurableTag_Outcome\",\n        \"DetectableTag_Pattern\"\n      ],\n      \"Value_Drivers\": [\"Increase Revenue\", \"Decrease Cost\", \"Decrease Brand Risk\"],\n      \"Reasoning_for_Value_Prop\": \"Clear explanation of how this use case drives business value through tag-based analytics.\",\n      \"TopicsToInsight\": \"Detailed explanation of how tag analysis, ratios, and temporal patterns generate actionable insights.\",\n      \"semantic_sql_ddl\": \"CREATE OR replace VIEW use_case_analytics_view AS\\nSELECT \\n  call_id,\\n  timestamp,\\n  agent_id,\\n  customer_id,\\n  tag_name,\\n  tag_confidence,\\n  theme_category,\\n  -- Add relevant aggregations, ratios, time windows\\n  COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY tag_name ORDER BY timestamp RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '7 days' PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as tag_7day_count,\\n  tag_count::FLOAT / total_tags::FLOAT as tag_ratio\\nFROM call_transcripts ct\\nJOIN call_tags ctags ON ct.call_id = ctags.call_id\\nJOIN customer_data cd ON ct.customer_id = cd.customer_id\\nWHERE tag_name IN ('SpecificTag_Action', 'MeasurableTag_Outcome')\\n  AND timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';\",\n      \"Insights_Unlocked\": [\n        {\n          \"business_question\": \"Specific, measurable business question that drives action?\",\n          \"required_data_sets\": [\"call_tags\", \"customer_data\", \"outcome_metrics\"],\n          \"hypothetical_answer\": \"Specific, quantified answer with percentages/dollar amounts.\",\n          \"action_to_take\": \"Concrete action that can be taken based on the insight.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"business_question\": \"Another business question building on tag analysis?\",\n          \"required_data_sets\": [\"call_tags\", \"agent_performance\", \"temporal_data\"],\n          \"hypothetical_answer\": \"Data-driven answer showing business impact.\",\n          \"action_to_take\": \"Specific operational change or intervention.\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"ROI_Summary\": \"Quantified ROI statement with specific dollar amounts and percentages based on tag-driven interventions.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\nKey Requirements:\nSQL DDL Specifications:\nEach use case must include a complete SQL view definition in the semantic_sql_ddl field\n\nSQL should reference the actual required_data_sets mentioned in business questions\n\nInclude relevant JOINs between call transcripts, tags, customer data, and other systems\n\nDemonstrate how tags are aggregated, windowed, and ratio'd for analysis\n\nShow time-based analysis (rolling windows, temporal patterns)\n\nInclude confidence scores and filtering logic for tag reliability\n\nTag Design Principles:\nAggregatable: Tags must be countable and measurable over time periods\n\nRatio-friendly: Design tags so ratios between them reveal business insights\n\nActionable: When tag patterns emerge, they should trigger specific business actions\n\nSpecific: Avoid generic tags - make them company/industry specific\n\nBusiness Question Quality:\nEach question must be answerable with the proposed data structure\n\nQuestions should drive immediate, measurable business actions\n\nInclude quantified hypothetical answers with specific metrics\n\nLink directly to revenue, cost, or risk outcomes\n\nOutput only the fully populated JSON - valid, complete, and ready-to-implement."
