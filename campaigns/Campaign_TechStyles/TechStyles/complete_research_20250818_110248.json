Consider advanced analytics like:\n     - Cross-process agent performance analytics with 360-degree KPI views\n     - Real-time sentiment prediction and dynamic call routing\n     - Predictive churn modeling based on conversation patterns\n     - Agent coaching automation using AI-powered quality assurance\n     - Revenue optimization through upsell/cross-sell moment detection\n     - Competitive intelligence from conversation mining\n     - Regulatory compliance monitoring and risk flagging\n     - Customer journey optimization across multiple touchpoints\n     - Proactive issue prevention using predictive analytics\n   - Each use case must stem from high-frequency or high-impact call types and demonstrated themes\n   - Make every use case value-driven with specific business impact quantification\n   - **Include at least one use case for competitive intelligence and one for predictive analytics**\n   - Ensure there are **at least 20 business questions total across all use cases**\n   - Each business question must include a `required_data_sets` field\n\n5. **Create Consumable Themes and Tags Structure:**\n   - **Themes**: High-level conceptual categories (e.g., \"escalation language patterns\", \"competitor switching signals\")\n   - **Tags**: Specific, detectable keywords, phrases, or patterns that can be aggregated, windowed, and ratio'd to tell stories about themes (e.g., \"WastingMyTime_GetManager\", \"CompetitorX_BetterPrice\", \"RefundDelay_BankDispute\")\n   - Tags should be specific enough that when aggregated over time windows and compared as ratios, they provide actionable insights about the theme\n\n6. **Output the following JSON structure:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data_customer_likely_has\": [\n    \"CRM (customer profiles, purchase history, lifecycle stage)\",\n    \"ERP (orders, fulfillment, inventory, refunds)\",\n    \"Product registration/warranty database\",\n    \"E-commerce transaction logs\",\n    \"Customer feedback surveys/NPS scores\",\n    \"IVR/call disposition and routing logs\",\n    \"Marketing campaign data and attribution\",\n    \"Agent performance metrics and scorecards\",\n    \"Knowledge base and FAQ interaction logs\",\n    \"Social media monitoring data\",\n    \"Competitive pricing and feature data\",\n    \"Financial/billing system data\"\n  ],\n  \"company_website\": \"company_website_url\",\n  \"call_center_number\": \"company_phone_number\",\n  \"call_center_usecases\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Predictive Churn Detection with Real-Time Intervention Triggers\",\n      \"themes_to_track\": [\n        \"escalation_language_patterns\",\n        \"competitor_switching_signals\",\n        \"value_proposition_questioning\",\n        \"cancellation_exploration_behavior\"\n      ],\n      \"tags_to_track\": [\n        \"WastingMyTime_GetManager\",\n        \"CompetitorX_BetterPrice\",\n        \"CancelSubscription_HowTo\",\n        \"NotWorthTheMoney_Overpriced\",\n        \"SwitchingTo_CompetitorY\",\n        \"RefundRequest_Immediate\",\n        \"UnresolvedIssue_MultipleContacts\",\n        \"FrustrationLevel_High\"\n      ],\n      \"Value_Drivers\": [\"Increase Revenue\", \"Decrease Brand Risk\"],\n      \"Reasoning_for_Value_Prop\": \"Advanced sentiment analysis combined with conversation pattern recognition can predict churn probability in real-time, triggering immediate retention actions during the call itself rather than post-call surveys.
